# Multiobjective-Overlapped-Subspace-Clustering

The method generates overlappied subspace clustering in a meta-heuristic based multi-objective framework.

# Motivation

Most of the previous subspace clustering methods have not considered an object to be a part of more than one cluster. However, in many real-life situations, an object may belong to more than one cluster. Moreover, subspace clustering algorithms developed in the past are based on single objective optimization framework which limits in optimizing only a particular shape or property of the clusters. 

# MO-OV-SubClust

This approach produces an overlapping subspace clusters. It is a multi-objective based evolutionary approach. It designed a new objective function to handle the ovelapping of objects and optimized it with other objective functions jnamed ICC index and PSM-index simultaneously.
